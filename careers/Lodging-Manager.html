                <h2>Who is a Lodging Manager</h2>
                <p>Lodging managers ensure that guests on vacation or business travel have a pleasant experience at a hotel, motel, or other types of establishments with accommodations. Lodging managers also ensure that the establishment is run efficiently and profitably.</p>
                <h5>The following are examples of types of lodging managers:</h5>
                <p><em>General Managers</em> oversee all lodging operations at a property. At large hotels with several departments and multiple layers of management, the general manager and several assistant managers coordinate the activities of separate departments. </p>
                <p>These departments may include housekeeping, human resources, room operations, marketing and sales, purchasing, security, maintenance, recreational facilities, and other activities. For more information, see the profiles on human resources managers; public relations and fundraising managers; financial managers; advertising, promotions, and marketing managers; and food service managers.</p>
                <p><em>Revenue managers</em> work in financial management, monitoring room sales and reservations, overseeing accounting and cash-flow matters at the hotel, projecting occupancy levels, and deciding which rooms to discount and when to offer special rates.</p>
                <p><em>Front-office managers</em> coordinate reservations and room assignments and train and direct the hotel’s front-desk staff. They ensure that guests are treated courteously, that complaints and problems are resolved, and that requests for special services are carried out. Most front-office managers are also responsible for adjusting bills.</p>
                <p><em>Convention service managers</em> coordinate the activities of various departments, to accommodate meetings, conventions, and special events. They meet with representatives of groups to plan the number of conference rooms to be reserved, design the configuration of the meeting space, and determine what other services the groups will need, such as catering or audiovisual requirements. During a meeting or event, they resolve unexpected problems and ensure that hotel operations meet a group’s expectations.</p>

                <p>Lodging managers are extroverts with a dominant preference for <em>Intuition</em> as a way to take in information. They make use of both <em>Feeling</em> and <em>Thinking</em> as the situation requires, so most Lodging managers do not have preference in making decisions and processing information. According to Donna Dung: Extroverts are individuals that ask questions and think out loud during activities or while working through decisions.</p>
