                <p><em>Resourcefulness. </em>Coaches must find and develop a game plan and strategy that yields the best chances for winning. Coaches often need to create original plays or formations that provide a competitive advantage and confuse opponents. – For them to efficiently do this, they must possess the following soft skills-set:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning Strategies — Selecting and using training/instructional methods and procedures appropriate for the situation when learning or teaching new things.</li>
                    <li>Management of Personnel Resources — Motivating, developing, and directing people as they work, identifying the best people for the job.</li>
                    <li>Systems Analysis — Determining how a system should work and how changes in conditions, operations, and the environment will affect outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Coaches and scouts typically need a bachelor’s degree. They also must have extensive knowledge of the sport. Coaches typically gain this knowledge through their own experiences playing the sport at some level. Although previous playing experience may be beneficial, it is not required for most scouting jobs.</p>
