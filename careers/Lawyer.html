                <h2>Who is a Lawyer</h2>
                <p>Lawyers advise and represent individuals, businesses, and government agencies on legal issues and disputes. They are also called attorneys, act as both advocates and advisors: As advocates, they represent one of the parties in a criminal or civil trial by presenting evidence and arguing in support of their client: As advisors, lawyers counsel their clients about their legal rights and obligations and suggest courses of action in business and personal matters. All attorneys research the intent of laws and judicial decisions and apply the laws to the specific circumstances that their clients face.</p>
                <p>Lawyers may have different titles and different duties, depending on where they work.</p>
                <p>In law firms, lawyers, sometimes called <em>associates</em>, perform legal work for individuals or businesses. Those who represent and defend the accused may be called <em>criminal law attorneys or defense attorneys</em>.</p>
                <p>Attorneys also work for federal, state, and local governments. Prosecutors typically work for the government to file a lawsuit, or charge, against an individual or corporation accused of violating the law. Some may also work as <em>public defense attorneys</em>, representing individuals who could not afford to hire their own private attorney.</p>
                <p>Others may work as <em>government counsels</em> for administrative bodies and executive or legislative branches of government. They write and interpret laws and regulations and set up procedures to enforce them. Government counsels also write legal reviews of agency decisions. They argue civil and criminal cases on behalf of the government.</p>
                <p><em>Corporate counsels</em>, also called <em>in-house counsels</em>, are lawyers who work for corporations. They advise a corporation’s executives about legal issues related to the corporation’s business activities. These issues may involve patents, government regulations, and contracts with other companies, property interests, taxes, or collective-bargaining agreements with unions.</p>
                <p><em>Public-interest lawyers</em> work for private, nonprofit organizations that provide legal services to disadvantaged people or others who otherwise might not be able to afford legal representation. They generally handle civil cases, such as those having to do with leases, job discrimination, and wage disputes, rather than criminal cases.</p>

According to Donna Dung, individuals with such personality preference tend to consider the pros and cons of ideas, information, and opinions, they also focus on what facts mean and how they fit together; they pay more attention to implications, possibilities, and relationships between ideas than to facts and details alone. Because they deal with law, Lawyers are tolerant of routines and structure.</p>

                <p><em>Research skills.</em> Lawyers need to be able to find those laws and regulations which apply to a specific matter, in order to provide the appropriate legal advice for their clients.</p>
                <p><em>Speaking skills.</em> Lawyers must be able to clearly present and explain their case to arbitrators, mediators, opposing parties, judges, or juries, because they are speaking on behalf of their clients. </p>
                <p><em>Writing skills.</em> Lawyers need to be precise and specific when preparing documents, such as wills, trusts, and powers of attorney.</p>
                
                <p>Lawyers must have a law degree and must also typically pass a state’s written bar examination. Prospective lawyers take licensing exams called “bar exams.” Lawyers who receive a license to practice law are “admitted to the bar.” And to practice law in any state, a person must be admitted to the state’s bar under rules established by the jurisdiction’s highest court. The requirements vary by state and jurisdiction. </p>
